<h3>"Don’t buy any nonessential items for a week—or even a month!</h3>
<p>Think about it as a contentment challenge. While you’re at it,
  take inventory of what you’re grateful for each day.
  This should help kick your “want-itis” in the pants!
  Make your spending freeze work by prepping meals with the food you already have,
  avoiding stores where you tend to impulse buy (did someone say Target dollar spot?),
  and saying no to anything that isn’t a basic necessity.
